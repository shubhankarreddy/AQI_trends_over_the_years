# AQI Trends Over The Years
Analyzed air quality data for 26 Indian cities (2015-2020) using Python, leveraging Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization, and Scikit-learn for developing a Linear Regression model. Techniques included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series analysis, and predictive modeling to uncover key pollution trends and patterns.

## Project Goals
- Explore the distribution of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, AQI).
- Identify relationships between variables (e.g., PM2.5 vs. AQI).
- Analyze trends in pollution levels over time.
- Perform metro city-wise analysis.
- Explore possibilities for AQI prediction.

## Data Description
The code expects the data to be in a CSV format with the following columns:

- date: Date of the measurement
- city: City name
- PM2.5: Concentration of fine particulate matter
- PM10: Concentration of coarse particulate matter
- AQI: Air Quality Index
