# AQI_trends_over_the_years
This project delves into air quality data analysis to understand pollution levels and their trends. It leverages Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to explore various aspects of the data.

## Project Goals
- Explore the distribution of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, AQI).
- Identify relationships between variables (e.g., PM2.5 vs. AQI).
- Analyze trends in pollution levels over time.
- Perform metro city-wise analysis.
- Explore possibilities for AQI prediction.

## Data Description
The code expects the data to be in a CSV format with the following columns:

-date: Date of the measurement
-city: City name=
-PM2.5: Concentration of fine particulate matter
-PM10: Concentration of coarse particulate matter
-AQI: Air Quality Index
